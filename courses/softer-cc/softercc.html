                    This event introduces creative coding with the visual coding framework P5.js (using the JavaScript
                    programming language). You will get to try your hand at using the basic building blocks of
                    programming to
                    draw and animate with code! The event is suitable for absolute beginners, but we can also try to
                    accomodate
                    if you come with more experience and are looking for inspiration for the next steps in your
                    learning. Bring
                    a laptop.
