              Most recently I worked as <b>assistant professor</b> at the

              teaching career in the next section below ↓

            <p>
              Previously, I worked as a <b>software engineer</b> at
              <a

                >LEGO</a
              >
              from 2021-2024. I was a fullstack enginner on the LEGO Ideas team,
              where helped rebuild a beloved social media platform (<a

                >LEGO ideas</a
              >), with millions of active users (Typescipt). Later I worked with
              backend microservices for internal order flow in the Order
              Orchestrator team. This team was tasked with replacing the legagcy
              software systems that handles all orders within LEGO concurrently,
              with modern cloud native solutions, mainly on the AWS platform.
              Both experiences taught me a great deal about working at scale,
              with incredibly high volumes of active users and orders, while
              maintaining a high level of reliability and performance.

              culture. I have contributed to a number of workshops, publications
              and podcasts since 2018. Topics include critical discussions and
              research into Artificial Intelligence and large languaghe models,
              the neo-right political movement towards greater surveilance,
              control and censorship, and the role of the tech oligarchy on all
              of our digital lives. In 2019, we collaborated with

              Spring 2021 I was invited to participate in an online residence
