                <p>This is a collection courses I have taught. Classes and workshops that I documented in different ways
                    over the years.
                </p>
                <p>I love finding inspiration in the curricula of others. I wish for this list
                    to motivate me to continue documenting and <a

                    the process of learning, teaching,
                    experimenting and producing knowledge.

                            Coding</b></a>, 2025. This event, also with <a href="https://www.softer.global/" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">Softer</a>, introduces creative coding with the visual coding framework
                    P5.js (using the JavaScript programming language). You will get to try your hand at using the basic
                    building blocks of programming to draw and animate with code! The event is suitable for absolute
                    beginners, but we can also try to accomodate if you come with more experience and are looking for
                    inspiration for the next steps in your learning.</p>

                    2025. I am making an intro talk with <a href="https://www.softer.global/" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">Softer</a> at their new space in CPH. I'll be talking about how I got
                    into programming, and how
                    I stuck it out in a technical space during ups and downs the last decade+.</p>
